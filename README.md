## Backstory
Each player is a resident of the same planet but each is a citizen of a different and rival state. As war rages between your countries with no clear end in sight, each of player's government independently comes to the same conclusion. A rare and volotile material is needed to power a not-so-secret weapon&mdash;the shrinkorator! A shrinkorator is a widely known but as-of-yet theoretical weapon that could be used to shrink an enemy down to a harmless size. The science has all been worked out years ago, the only thing keeping the generals from employing a weapon like this is that to power a shrinkorator requires the most precious of all metals in the galaxy&mdash;tin!

Tin does not exist on our planet. Plain and simple. There are rumors of a tin mine on the other side of the galaxy, but retrieving tin from those mines is a dangerous and treacherous mission. Of course you volunteer as soon as you hear about it. You are quite brave.

Your mission, to be quite clear, is to take a cargo ship to the tin planet, load it up, and bring it back so your country's scientists can shrink the enemy to bug size. Of course if you are not first, your countrymen will all be shrunk. Godspeed.

## Objective
Each player is trying to be the first to get from their home planet to the planet with tin mines on the other side of the galaxy and back. Fuel is quite limited in this galaxy so players' space ships are only able to go in short bursts to nearby planets. They must plan their trip across the galaxy based on the alignment and movement of planets.

## Mechanics

### Time
Time is split up into epochs, turns and ticks. An epoch is the time it takes for every player to complete a turn, a turn is a turn, and each player's turn is split into 12 ticks. Planets advance one spot in their orbit at the start of each tick. Planets go around their sun at different speeds. The dots along a planet's orbit path indicate where the planet will go with each tick. Each tick, the player who's turn it is can choose to do nothing, use a resource, or move to a nearby planet in its burst range.

### Fuel
Each player's space ship is powered by solar energy and so players will have to take detours to suns to recharge when they are getting too low. One fuel unit is recharged with every 12 ticks (regardless of whose turn it is).

It takes one fuel unit to jump to a nearby planet.

#### Burst Range
During a player's turn his spaceship is surrounded by a ring indicating how far his ship can travel in a tick. A planet must be at least partially within this "burst range ring" to be accessible to the ship. It is possible to increase one's burst range with the turbo boost resource.

### Tools

- #### Time Bomb
	Once this bomb is detonated it reverses every planets orbit for remainder of epoch.
	Recipe: 6 units of radium, 6 units of copper

- #### Time Doubler
	Pull the trigger on this tool and it makes subsequently used tools last twice as long.
	Recipe: 4 units of tungsten, 4 units of radium, 4 units of copper

- #### Turbo Booster
	This increases your ship's burst range. Lasts for 1 epoch.
	Recipe: 4 units of radium, 8 units of mercury

- #### Extreme turbo booster

- #### Time Freezer
	Freeze planets

- #### Warp Speed
	Go double time

- #### Fuel Pack
	Sometimes you can get fuel this way without having to go to a sun.
	Recipe: 12 units of radium

-	#### Tool Grabber
	Use this to steal a tool form another player
	Recipe: 6 units of tungsten, 6 unit of radium

- #### Future Revealer
	This tool lets you watch the movements of the planets at high-speed for 2 epochs
	Recipe: 12 units of tungsten

### Materials
Tools are built using raw materials. All available tools can be built on-board spaceships from combining 4 elemental raw materials in certain amounts. The elements from least to most rare are:

- Tungsten (blue)
- Radium (purple)
- Copper (red)
- Mercury (orange)

You acquire these elements by mining t	hem on planets that are rich in them. E.g. If you spend 6 ticks mining on a tungsten rich (blue) planet you'll be able to mine 1 unit of tungsten. You can store 60 units of any element on your ship at one time. Once you use up elements by building tools you'll free up more space.

Of course 24 units of Tin are required to build the shrinkerator, and scientists will need huge labs on the home planet to build it, so that is not being considered with these lesser tools. But tin is mined in the same way.

### Your Turn
On each tick while it's your tun, you can sit, mine, or jump. Sit means do nothing and let the tick pass. Mine means to collect the element of the planet your on, and jump means to go to a nearby planet.

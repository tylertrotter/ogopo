## Backstory
Each player is a resident of the same planet but each is a citizen of a different and rival state. As war rages between your countries with no clear end in sight, each of player's government independently comes to the same conclusion. A rare and volotile material is needed to power a not-so-secret weapon&mdash;the shrinkorator! A shrinkorator is a widely known but as-of-yet theoretical weapon that could be used to shrink an enemy down to a harmless size. The science has all been worked out years ago, the only thing keeping the generals from employing a weapon like this is that to power a shrinkorator requires the most precious of all metals in the galaxy&mdash;tin!

Tin does not exist on our planet. Plain and simple. There are rumors of a tin mine on the other side of the galaxy, but retrieving tin from those mines is a dangerous and treacherous mission. Of course you volunteer as soon as you hear about it. You are quite brave.

Your mission, to be quite clear, is to take a cargo ship to the tin planet, load it up, and bring it back so your country's scientists can shrink the enemy to bug size. Of course if you are not first, your countrymen will all be shrunk. Godspeed.

## Objective
Each player is trying to be the first to get from their home planet to the planet with tin mines on the other side of the galaxy and back. Fuel is quite limited in this galaxy so players' space ships are only able to go in short bursts to nearby planets. They must plan their trip across the galaxy based on the alignment and movement of planets.

## Mechanics

### Time
Time is split up into epochs, turns and ticks. An epoch is the time it takes for every player to complete a turn, a turn is a turn, and each player's turn is split into 10 ticks. Planets advance one spot in their orbit at the start of each tick. Planets go around their sun at different speeds. The dots along a planet's orbit path indicate where the planet will go with each tick. Each tick, the player who's turn it is can choose to do nothing, use a resource, or move to a nearby planet in its burst range.

### Fuel
Each player's space ship is powered by solar energy and so players will have to take detours to suns to recharge when they are getting too low. The bigger the sun the more energy is stored up with each tick.

#### Burst Range
During a player's turn his spaceship is surrounded by a ring indicating how far his ship can travel in a tick. A planet must be at least partially within this "burst range ring" to be accessible to the ship. It is possible to increase one's burst range with the turbo boost resource.

### Resources

- #### Turbo Boost
	This increases your ship's burst range.

- #### Time Warp Bomb
	Once this bomb is detonated it reverses every planets orbit.

- #### Time Elongater
	Pull the trigger on this resource before any other in your turn and it makes other resources used later in the turn last longer (more epochs, turns or ticks).

- #### Fuel Pack
	Sometimes you can get fuel this way without having to go to a sun.

-	#### Resource Stealer
	Use this to steal a resource form another player

- #### Future Revealer Gadget
	This resource lets you watch the movements of the planets at high-speed for 2 epochs

# Other Information

## On the Name
Omobo means Clockwork in the Mookogoo language. It literally translates to "toilet plumbing" but since Earth toilets work so differently, clockwork is a much better translation.

## Grammar Rules
- The only sounds in the language are the ones roughly corresponding to K, G, P, B, M, O as in no, and OO as in zoo.
- Each sound has its own letter in the alphabet.
- Words must have between 3 and 7 letters.
- Vowels and consonants must alternate.
- Isolated words can be written right to left, but when arranged in sentences, words flow from top to bottom, sentences, made up of columns of stacked words, flow right to left.
- A XXXXX who violoates any of these rules will be executed. Foreign, non-native, speakers will be jailed for 2 months. (17 Earth years)

## Mookogoo Physiognomy
Most of the body mass of a Mookogoo is contained in its head, which has one large eye, an emotion-indicator* or koobo, and is topped by a flexible funnel-shapped extension (called an koobo) for intaking food, sound, and emmitting speech. Encircling this head, are hundreds* of cillia like hair-thin legs. When Mookogoos want to move about they extend these cillia and roll a to the desired location. The cillia provide a surprising amount of directional control, but for sharp turns and even jumps the Mookogoo will employee its strong koobo to propel it.

Mookogoos are diveded into two sexes. The flesh color of males is much brighter than that of their female counterparts. Females tend to have a wider koobo*, resulting in a deeper voice.

*Called a mouth by the un-informed. Though it is positioned similarly to a human mouth and coincidentally indicates emotions with similar shapes as a human smile or frown, there is no justification for the serious scientist calling it a mouth. No food is consumed and no speach emitted from this strange phenomenon. The safest course is to just call it by its Mookogoo word, obo.

*Cf. G.H. Robernson in his seminal work which claims the number is in the thousands.

*Usefull for egg-laying
